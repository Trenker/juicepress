# Static Blog Generator

Juicepress is a node package that generates a blog of HTML files from markdown sources. Currently, it must be invoked via [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [gulp](http://gulpjs.com). Direct calls and other build tools are not yet supported.

## Installation and Usage

This requires a plugin for a build tool

* [grunt-contrib-juicepress](https://github.com/trenker/grunt-contrib-juicepress#Installation)
* [gulp-juicepress](https://github.com/trenker/gulp-juicepress#Installation)

See the readme of this packages to find out, how to install and call it.

A fully working example can be seen at <https://github.com/trenker/juicepress-example>

## Rendering

The creation of a blog consists of the following steps:

1. Read all markdown files, which are considered posts
2. Create category and tags information based on the YFM in the posts
3. Create a schedule of actual HTML pages to render, including splitted lists with pagination over several HTML files

### Pages

There are two types of pages: posts and lists

* *posts* are blog posts which use markdown and are rendered using the *defaultTemplate* or the one configured in the YFM
* *lists* are lists of blog posts. They always use the *listTemplate*

There are three types of lists:

* *index* is the index page(s) of the blog, containing all posts
* *category* are the lists of posts that belong to a certain category
* *tag* the same as category lists, but this time the relation is created by the tags a post has.

All posts are sorted in chronological order with the newest first and the oldest last, aka descending. The relation, which categories and tags a post has, is defined in the YFM.

### Templates

There must be at least two templates: *default* for posts and *list* for lists. All templates are rendered using handlebars, so you can use all the handlebars options and possibilities.

Additionally all options and YFM settings are available

### Targets

This does not refer to grunt targets. Instead, it's the URL of a page. Each page has a *target* property, a relative file name without file ending.

eg.:

A post with the title *My Post* and two categories *Top*, *Lower* (in that order!) will have the target `top/lower/my-post`

The second page of the posts listing of a category with the name *Main Category* and the default juicepress options, will have the target `categories/main-category/page-2`

This targets determine

1. How the URLs are created when using the helper `link_post`
2. To which file a page will be written.

### Helpers

The following helpers are registered for all layouts:

`{{link_post "name or target" }}`
Will create an URL to the given post. 

eg.: a target "top/lower/my-post" and the default juicepress options will create the URL "/top/lower/my-post.html"
